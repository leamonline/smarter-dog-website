## Backup Procedures

### Code Backups

- **Primary**: Git repository (GitHub/GitLab)
- **Recommended**: Enable automatic backups on hosting provider (Vercel/Netlify)

### How to backup manually

```bash
# Create a dated zip of the project
zip -r "smarterdog-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).zip" . -x "node_modules/*" -x ".git/*"
```

### Recovery

```bash
# Clone from Git
git clone <repository-url>
cd bestwebsitesofar-1
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables for production:

```bash
# EmailJS Configuration (for booking form)
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key

# Google Analytics
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

**Security**: Never commit `.env` files to Git. Use hosting provider's environment variable settings.

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] Run lint: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Run tests: `npm run test:run`
- [ ] Run E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- [ ] Build succeeds: `npm run build`
- [ ] Check bundle size: `npm run build:analyze`

- [ ] ### Bluehost FTP Deployment (CI)

The `deploy` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` syncs `dist/` to Bluehost via FTPS using `SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action`.

**FTP account scope matters.** The account behind the `BLUEHOST_FTP_USER` secret is a sub-FTP account scoped to `/home1/<cpanel-user>/public_html`. Because that account's FTP root *is* `public_html/`, the workflow uses `server-dir: ./`.

Do **not** use `/public_html/` (absolute) or `public_html/` (relative) with this account — both resolve to `public_html/public_html/` and the deploy will fail when it tries to step into `public_html/assets/`.

**If the FTP account is ever recreated or rotated:**

- Sub-account scoped to `public_html/` → keep `server-dir: ./`
- Main cPanel user (lands in `/home1/<cpanel-user>/`, above the website folder) → change `server-dir` to `public_html/` (no leading slash)
- Sub-account scoped to a subfolder of `public_html/` (e.g. `public_html/leam`) → won't work; recreate it scoped to `public_html` itself

The action stores its incremental-sync state in `.ftp-deploy-sync-state.json` at the FTP root. If you switch FTP accounts, the first deploy under the new account will look like a "first publish" (uploads everything) until that file exists; subsequent deploys are diffs.
